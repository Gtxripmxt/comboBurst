# Combo Burst

Inspired by osu's combo burst.

# Sprite Packs

## Custom Sprites
If you want to add your own sprites, create a folder in the mod's save folder named "custom-sprite" and add your sprites there.  

Each character must have two files:
1. `comboburst-1.png` - The sprite that will be displayed. (.png)
2. `comboburst-1.wav` - The sound that will be played. (.wav, .ogg, mp3, etc.)

All sprites with a running number starting from 1 will be loaded.
(Example: `comboburst-1.png`, `comboburst-2.png`, `comboburst-3.png`, etc.)
