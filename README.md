Combo Burst in osu! now implemented in Geometry Dash!  

# Custom sprite packs

If you want to add your own sprites, create a folder in the mod's save folder named "sprites" and add your sprites there.
The mods save folder is located in `Settings -> Open Folder`

Each character must have two files:
1. `cb_char1.png` - The sprite that will be displayed.
2. `cb_char1.wav` - The sound that will be played. (optional; but recommended)  
(Supported Audio Files: .ogg, .wav, .mp3, .m4a, .flic)  
(.ogg audio files are highly recommended for the best audio quality)  

All sprites with a running number starting from 1 will be loaded.
(Example: `cb_char1.png`, `cb_char2.png`, `cb_char3.png`, etc.)

A game restart is not needed for the custom sprite pack to be effective.  
Note that the more sprites you add, the longer the level may have to load.  

You may find a sprite pack example under ./resources/custom-sprite/

If you find any bugs, you may post it in the issues tab.
